# Introduction  
Some resources for Pytorch

## \_\_init\_\_.pyi

`__init__.pyi` is the file to solve the problem:
there is no code hints for Pytorch in Pycharm.

Steps:
* Upgrade Pycharm to 2019.1.1
* Download `__init__.pyi`
* Upgrade Pytorch to 1.0.1.post2 (the `__init__.pyi` in this project
is modified from the `__init__.pyi` of Pytorch 1.0.1.post2)
* Replace `site-packages/torch/__init__.pyi` with download one.
